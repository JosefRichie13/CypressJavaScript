# CypressJavaScript

This repo has the code which implements a Cypress Test framework using JavaScript for the website, https://www.saucedemo.com/

It also has API scenarios from https://restful-booker.herokuapp.com/apidoc/index.html

Please note that the website under test, https://www.saucedemo.com/, has some issues with Cypress, https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/27501. So, some tests may fail randomly.

Project setup guide is available in the PDF doc [CypressJavaScript.pdf](CypressJavaScript.pdf)
